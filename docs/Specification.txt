Website Frontend Development Task
===========

This taks is designed to understand how you deal with a complex problem, while focusing on code quality, maintainability and readability.
Although the details of the implementation are up to you, please use the following frameworks on your deliverable:

- Javascript / jQuery
- Bootstrap
- HTML (of course) that works on most browsers

- Bonus: Use AngularJS


Description
----------------

Create a website with a login/signup functionality that will lead to a user's dashboard. On the dashboard the user will be able to pick two cities and get a list of flights between them.

- The list of cities must have at least 100 cities
- There must be at least 3 flights between each city
- The user will be able to sort the flights by price and take off time

- Bonus: the user can choose to display flights with 0, 1 or 2 stops
- Extra Bonus: add other sorting capabilities



IMPORTANT - the list of all possible flights (min 3x100x99 = 29700) must exist in a variable and cannot be generated on the fly when the user picks both cities. You should efficiently filter the list.

Define the API calls you need to complete this task, and for the purporse of this test populate them with fake data (that is, a fake list of cities and a fake list of flights.)



Other considerations
--------------------

Use of third-party libraries (apart from jQuery / AngularJS and Bootstrap) is permitted, but strongly discouraged.
